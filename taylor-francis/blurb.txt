Collecting and analyzing data is now as important to research as telescopes and
test tubes. At the same time, traditional print media are being supplanted by
dynamic online delivery. Researchers who can turn data into insight need to be
able to publish their discoveries and the data that back them up online.

This book introduces data scientists to these topics using JavaScript, the one
unavoidable language for sharing, reporting, visualizing, and interacting online.
It introduces readers to its power and ideosyncracies, and guides them through
the key features of modern JavaScript and the tools and libraries. The book
places equal focus on client- and server-side programming, and shows the reader
how to create interactive web content, build and test data services, and visualize
data in the browser.
