\chapter{Finale}\label{s:finale}

We have come a long way since \texttt{console.log('hello,\ world')} in \chapref{s:basics}.
Callbacks and promises,
JSON and web servers,
packaging, unit tests, and visualization:
every modern language can do them,
but JavaScript is an increasingly popular choice.
Yes,
it has its flaws,
but if we avoid some of the legacy features in \appref{s:legacy}
it's both usable and powerful.

Our journey doesn't stop here, though.
The appendices explore some next steps,
such as logging what our server does (\appref{s:logging})
and using a relational database (\appref{s:db}) instead of a text file
as a data store.
Beyond that,
you could look at more advanced techniques in JavaScript \cite{Have2018},
explore the full power of the \hreffoot{https://d3js.org/}{D3} library for interactive visualization \cite{Meek2017},
dive into data wrangling \cite{Davi2018},
or start over completely the way JavaScript programmers do every eight months
and rewrite everything with \hreffoot{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web\_Components}{Web Components}.
Whatever you do,
we hope that this tutorial has helped you get started.
